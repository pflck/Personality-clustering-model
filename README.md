The scale was labeled 1=Disagree, 3=Neutral, 5=Agree

### Additional Information

* **Time Spent per Question**: Recorded in milliseconds (variables ending in `_E`). This was calculated by taking the time when the button for the question was clicked minus the time of the most recent other button click.
* **Other Variables**:

  * `dateload`: The timestamp when the survey was started.
  * `screenw`: The width of the user's screen in pixels.
  * `screenh`: The height of the user's screen in pixels.
  * `introelapse`: Time in seconds spent on the landing/intro page.
  * `testelapse`: Time in seconds spent on the page with the survey questions.
  * `endelapse`: Time in seconds spent on the finalization page (where users confirmed they had answered accurately and their answers could be stored and used for research; only users who answered "Yes" are included).
  * `IPC`: The number of records from the user's IP address in the dataset. For clean analysis, only use records where this value is 1. High values may be due to shared networks (e.g. universities) or multiple submissions.
  * `country`: The country, determined by technical information (not asked as a question).
  * `lat_appx_lots_of_err`: Approximate latitude of the user, determined by technical information (note: **not very accurate** â€” see [this article](https://splinternews.com/how-an-internet-mapping-glitch-turned-a-random-kansas-f-1793856052) for details on how IP geolocation can be problematic).
  * `long_appx_lots_of_err`: Approximate longitude of the user.
